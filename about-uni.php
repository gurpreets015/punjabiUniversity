                Punjabi University Patiala, one of the premier institutions of higher education in the north of India, was established on the <i>30th April, 1962 under the Punjabi University Act 1961.</i> This is the second University in the world to be named after a language, the first being Hebrew University of Israel. Although initially the main task before the University was to develop and promote the language of the Punjabi people, it has since evolved into a multi-faceted,  multi-faculty educational institution with over fifty five teaching and research departments covering disciplines in Humanities and in Sciences as diverse as Fine Arts and Space Physics.             
The University has a modern well planned campus located about seven kilometers from the Patiala city, called the City of Gardens. The campus is spread over about 320 acres with imposing buildings in lush green, pollution- free environment away from the hustle and bustle of city life. The University also has three regional centres namely The Guru Kashi Regional Centre at Bathinda, The Guru Kashi Campus at Talwandi Sabo and The Nawab Sher Mohammad Khan Institute of Advanced Studies in Urdu, Persian and Arabic at Malerkotla.

The buildings of the estate have been renovated keeping the original architecture intact. Arrangements have been made for the comfortable stay of faculty members and students who wish to carry out study and research in the field of Theatre and Television. The Department of Theatre and Television arranges theatre performances at Andretta every year.

The transport Department of the University runs a fleet of buses for linking the campus to various parts of Patiala city. There are three residential Hostels for boys and four residential Hostels for girls. The Hostels have all modern amenities for comfortable living for 2000 students.

To keep pace with global thought processes and for updating of contemporary consciousness, every year the University has undertaken series of Lectures, Seminars and Conferences. To make the University a vibrant global centre for Punjabi language, literature and culture, a new faculty of Arts and Culture has been created. Originality and authencity in the pursuit of Sikh Studies is another area which is also receiving more attention and energy. Dr. Balbir Singh Sahitya Kendra Dehradun is being developed as an Advanced Centre for Sikh Studies. Punjabi University has established the first ever overseas centre for teaching of Punjabi as a foreign language at Espanola, New Mexico.

The Web-site at the University Campus is projecting our research into the world horizon. Path breaking strides are being encouraged for realizing breakthroughs in Computer Science, Space Science, Bio-technology and Pharmacy where innovative research is under way.

All the departments are involved to promote research culture and spirit. Most of the departments have been able to mobilize additional research funding from UGC, DST, CSIR, Planning Commission, Government Departments and other official funding agencies. Some science departments have been able to develop research  tie-ups with industry and have undertaken several consultancy assignments. Several faculty members have won national and international awards in recognition to their research work.
